calender
- make a list of all the days
- make a list of all the months
- give all the months a number (1, 2, 3, 4, ...)
- make the year a variable(?) that does +1 when the month is 12
- render the days in a calender format (display: grid)
- make the forward and backward buttons
- show the current month and year on the top
- when you click on the forward button, the next month is shown (month +1)
- when you click on the backward button, the previous month is shown (month -1)
- make it so that when you go to the next month, the days are rendered in the correct order
- make it so that when you go to the previous month, the days are rendered in the correct order
- update the year when the month is 12
